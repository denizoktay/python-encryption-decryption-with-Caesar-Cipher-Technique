# python-encryption-decryption-with-Caesar-Cipher-Technique
It can be used for to encrypt/decrypt text files. This technique is called Caesar Cipher. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet.

     It is an encryption/decryption program. It uses a technique which is called Caesar Cipher. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down/up the alphabet. In my program this number is 1. But it is so easy to modify this program for other numbers.
         For Encription
With a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, 
B would become C, 
C would become D,
D would become E,
E would become F,
F would become G,
G would become H,
H would become I,
I would become J,
J would become K,
K would become L,
L would become M,
M would become N,
N would become O,
O would become P,
P would become Q,
Q would become R,
R would become S,
S would become T,
T would become U,
U would become V,
V would become W,
W would become X,
X would become Y,
Y would become Z,
Z would become A.
And it is smilar for small letters too.

      For Decription
With a shift of 1, A would be replaced by Z, 
B would become A, 
C would become B,
D would become C,
E would become D,
F would become E,
G would become F,
H would become G,
I would become H,
J would become I,
K would become J,
L would become K,
M would become L,
N would become M,
O would become N,
P would become O,
Q would become P,
R would become Q,
S would become R,
T would become S,
U would become T,
V would become U,
W would become V,
X would become W,
Y would become X,
Z would become Y.
And it is smilar for small letters too.



      This program make changes with using Unicode values of the characters in input file .
      Basically, I used Unicode values of 'a' , 'z' , 'A' and 'Z' to shift each character ONE place down/up the alphabet.
These are 4 Unicode values I used:
The symbol for the letter A is represented by character number 65.
The symbol for the letter Z is represented by character number 90.
The symbol for the letter a is represented by character number 97.
The symbol for the letter z is represented by character number 122.

     For to use it properly First we should encrypt any text we want, then we can decrypt it again to see the program works right.


     I selected to make this program because I am interested in encryption techniques .
     
     First Run FIRST_Encryption_DenizOktay_PythonAssignment2.py
     Then, run SECOND_Decryption_DenizOktay_PythonAssignment2.py
